# draw_tricorn
C program with Python GUI wrapper for drawing fractals (Multicorn, Mandelbrot, Julia) adapted from the internet.

Most code was adapted from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mandelbrot_set_-_multiplier_map.png.

The python code is not fully optimized since I'm not so familiar with making GUIs.

## To do
- Make a pretty GUI that supports user input.
- Change method to calculate multiplier map to means.
- Add grayscale drawing to the fractals for better view of whats inside.
